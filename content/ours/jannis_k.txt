In the game:

    General:
        The style is medieval old. The mood a bit mysterious and exciting.

        The game master usually gives you the tasks.
        
        The game ends itself if you have a task in real life or if you just want to wait.
        (Then there is the task that you have to do on the screen or a countdown runs down)
        (In the background there is always a dark cave with the game master who is waiting for you)

        The player only has a limited inventory (maybe you can expand comb with a backpack).
        He can only have one object in his hand (sign also in the other hand)

        The game itself is everything in a big level with a huge map
        There will be a mini map in the top right of the corner so that the player has a better overview of the world
        The Mini Map is only gradually uncovered.

        In itself, you can enter all places, but it is intended that some places can only be entered with a certain strength / level.
        That is why you are warned by an NPC or the game master that you may not be strong enough.
        If the player still exceeds the place, he will not have a chance against the monsters.
        And then it is up to the player whether you will survive or the game will be over forever

        You can only play the game once.
        Once you have died and you try to start the game, the lettering comes, "you had your chance".
